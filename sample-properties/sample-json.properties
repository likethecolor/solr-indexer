# The convention for lists are for each element to be delimited by a semi-colon
# for example: key=value0;value1;value2
#
# The convention for elements of a list that have more than one value is to
# delimit each element with a colon.
#
# For example, if a list contains one element and that element has 2 parts:
#
#  key=part0:part1
#
# If an entry is a list that contains elements with multiple parts:
#
#  key=partA0:partA1;partB0:partB1
#

# name: batch-size
# type: integer
#
# The number of docs to send to solr for indexing in each batch.
#

# name: collection-name
# type: string
#
# The name of solr collection.

# name: fields
# type: list
#
# The data file will contain multiple columns.  This application does not pay
# attention to the names of those columns as they may appear in the file (first
# line/header is ignored - see first-row-is-header below).
#
# This application uses only the column positions.  This list maps the column
# positions to the solr field names.
#
# The format of the list is:
#
#   field_name:field_type:date format
#
# The field_name is the name of the solr field.
# The field_type is the data type (see Constants.FIELD_TYPE_).
#
#  datetime
#  double
#  int
#  long
#  multivalued
#  string
#
#   If no type is given string is assumed.
# The third part is an optional date format (see SimpleDateFormat).
#

# type: list
#
# This is a map from the fields field to the JSON key.
#

# name: path-to-data-file
# type: string
#
# This should be the full path to the file containing data that needs to be
